# timbr

Tim wants to know the performance of his car. Using the timbr app he can log the data and then over time figure it out. For instance, Tim can create a “Car Performance” category. Then each time he opens timbr he can log the amount of miles he drives or fuel he uses. With the data Tim logs in timbr, the app can show him graphs of his logs and predict trends.

## Project Requirements

### Required (core) user stories:
- Create categories that the user wants to log
- Within those categories, create a schema to map the data a user wants to log
- User can see a detail view of a log entry
- Data can be synced to a backend parse
- User can see charts or graph so data they have logged
- User can take a picture to upload to the log entry
- User can see how many steps they took
- User can see what photos they took
- User can graph locations they were in

### Optional user stories:
- Use camera
- Make a website that shows the data we’ve synced with Parse
- User can see a graph of the weather they've experienced.
- The app will predict trends based on past data.
