# timbr

Tim wants to know the performance of his car. Using the timbr app he can log the data and then over time figure it out. Tim can create a “Car Performance” category. Then each time he opens timbr he can log the amount of miles or amount of fuel he uses. With the data Tim logs in timbr, the app can show him graphs of his logs and predict trends.

## Project Requirements

- User can take a picture to upload to the log entry

### Optional user stories:
